# My Modern Application (2023)

A sample application for demonstrating the techniques and tools I currently use in developing an application.

## Application context

The context of the application is not much important. It is a simple application for managing a set of personal contacts. The application is composed of a REST API and a web frontend application.

## The data model

The data model of the application is described in the following diagram.

```mermaid
classDiagram
    class Contact {
        <<entity>>
        id: Long
        firstName: String
        lastName: String
    }
    class Address {
        <<entity>>
        id: Long
        street: String
        city: String
        zipCode: String
        country: String
    }
    class Email {
        <<entity>>
        id: Long
        address: String
    }
    class Phone {
        <<entity>>
        id: Long
        number: String
    }
    class ContactUse {
        <<entity>>
        id: Long
        name: String
    }
    Contact "1" -- "0..*" Address
    Contact "1" -- "0..*" Email
    Contact "1" -- "0..*" Phone
    Address "0..*" -- "1" ContactUse
    Email "0..*" -- "1" ContactUse
    Phone "0..*" -- "1" ContactUse
    note for ContactUse "The use of a 'destination' by a contact.\n\nFor example: 'Home', 'Primary', 'Work', etc."
```

## Project modularization

At present the project is composend by a parent Maven project and two modules: `data` and `api`.

The `data` module contains the data model and the JPA-based persistence layer.

The `api` module contains the REST API.

In the future will be added another module for the frontend application (Angular and/or React).
